The Project is about Making Clusters using K-means and cosine Similarities

FLOW OF THE PROJECT :-

WebScrapping and finding all the pdf url, html url and pdf title
2.  Pdf Scarapping and making corpus of all the texts
3.  Preprocessing Stage (stemming, re, lemmetization)
4.  Word Embedding using FASTTEXT
5.  PCA is to be applied to reduce the dimensions
6.  K-Means Clustering Algorithm is to be used for cluttering 
7.  Search Corpus and embedding will be followed
8.  The distance of Search Corpus Will be compared with centroids of the clusters
